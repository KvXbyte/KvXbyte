Hi, I’m **Nickalos** — but here you can call me **KvXbyte**.

I’m a cybersecurity professional with a **Security+** certification, currently leveling up through labs, Splunk training, and real-world simulations. I’m passionate about defending systems, analyzing signals, and turning chaos into clarity — one byte at a time.
